Rust Koans
==========

Well not yet, the current dev branch includes learning tests for Rust, which might one day transform into koans.

Requires
--------

- python, for "pretty printing"
- nightly [rustc](http://rust-lang.org)

Runnning
--------

Run `make run` to run all tests.

Note
----

As Rust is in beta and the syntax is still changing this might not compile on current nigtly build.
